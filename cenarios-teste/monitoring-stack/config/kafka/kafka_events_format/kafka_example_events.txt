can i configure the openNMS kafka consumer in the karak shell to deserialize events ?

Yes, you can configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to deserialize events in the Karaf shell. Here are the steps:

    Log in to the Karaf shell by running the following command:

bash

$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/karaf

    Use the following command to list the available Kafka consumer configurations:

lua

opennms> config:list "(service.factoryPid=org.opennms.features.kafka.consumer.cfg)"

    Find the PID (Process Identifier) of the Kafka consumer you want to configure.

    Use the following command to edit the Kafka consumer configuration:

lua

opennms> config:edit <PID>

    Use the following command to set the value of the value.deserializer property to the appropriate deserializer for your events. For example, if your events are serialized as protobuf, you could use the ByteArrayDeserializer:

python

opennms> config:property-set value.deserializer "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArrayDeserializer"

    Save and exit the configuration editor by running the following command:

lua

opennms> config:update

After completing these steps, the OpenNMS Kafka consumer should be able to deserialize the events from the Kafka topic using the configured deserializer.

if the event is not in protobuf and i read it with the openNMS kafka consumer and i deserialize it in the consumer can it be read correctly

It depends on the format of the event you are reading from the Kafka topic. If the event is not in the expected format that OpenNMS is configured to read (in this case, Protobuf), then the deserialization process will likely fail and OpenNMS will not be able to process the event correctly.

If you want to read events in a format other than Protobuf, you will need to modify the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to be able to deserialize events in that format. This will likely require modifying the consumer's code and configuration, and may require additional dependencies or libraries to be added to the OpenNMS Karaf container.

can i configure the openNMS kafka consumer in the karaf shell to be able to form the correct openNMS format after reading the event ?

No, you cannot configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer in the Karaf shell to automatically form the correct OpenNMS format after reading an event. The consumer expects the events to be in a specific format (protobuf format in this case), and it cannot automatically convert events in other formats to the expected format.

You will need to write custom code to read the events from the Kafka topic, convert them to the OpenNMS format, and then send them to OpenNMS for further processing. You can use a Kafka consumer library in your preferred programming language to read events from the Kafka topic, and then use a protobuf library to parse and serialize the events in the OpenNMS format. Once you have the events in the correct format, you can send them to OpenNMS through the REST API or other available integration methods.

can i configure the openNMS kafka message broker to read a topic with alarms ?

OpenNMS Kafka Message Broker does not consume or read topics directly. It is primarily responsible for producing messages to Kafka topics.

To consume or read topics with alarms, you can use the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer feature. This feature allows you to configure OpenNMS to consume messages from Kafka topics, transform them into OpenNMS events, and create or update alarms based on those events.

You can configure the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer to consume from the topic that contains alarms, and then map the message format to the OpenNMS event format using a custom deserializer. Once the messages are properly deserialized, the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer can then create or update alarms in the OpenNMS system.

Keep in mind that the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer is designed to consume messages in the OpenNMS event format, so you may need to perform additional transformations on the messages to ensure that they are properly deserialized and mapped to the appropriate event fields.

what if i deserialize the events and alarms to protobuf and they have the correct openNMS paramenters but with diferent names. can openNMS detect those and read the alarm and events correctly?

If the protobuf messages have the correct OpenNMS parameters but with different names, the OpenNMS Kafka consumer may not be able to read the events and alarms correctly because it expects the parameters to have specific names that match the OpenNMS schema. However, it's possible to create a custom deserializer that can translate the names of the parameters from the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema. This would require some programming and knowledge of the OpenNMS schema, but it's possible to do.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
can i do that through openNMS karaf shell?

Yes, you can configure OpenNMS through the Karaf shell. The Karaf shell provides a command-line interface to manage and configure OpenNMS. You can use it to add or update properties in the OpenNMS configuration files, manage bundles, start or stop services, and more.

To access the Karaf shell, you can use the following command from your OpenNMS installation directory:

python

./bin/karaf

Once you are in the Karaf shell, you can use the config:property-set command to set or update a property in the OpenNMS configuration files. For example, to set the kafka.consumer.topics property to read from a Kafka topic with alarms, you can use the following command:

vbnet

config:property-set org.opennms.features.kafka.consumer.topics "alarms"

This assumes that you have the OpenNMS Kafka feature installed and that you have the appropriate Kafka configuration in your OpenNMS configuration files. You may need to adjust the command based on your specific configuration.

Note that changing configuration properties through the Karaf shell may require you to restart OpenNMS for the changes to take effect. You can use the system:shutdown command to gracefully stop OpenNMS and the system:start command to start it again.

but can i to create a custom deserializer that can translate the names of the parameters from the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema

Yes, you can create a custom deserializer in Java that can translate the names of the parameters from the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema.

To create a custom deserializer in Java, you can implement the org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer interface and implement the deserialize method. In this method, you can read the bytes of the incoming message and translate them into an instance of your custom event or alarm class.

In the process of deserialization, you can also translate the names of the parameters in the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema. Once you have the instance of your custom event or alarm class with the expected parameter names, you can convert it to the protobuf format and send it to the Kafka topic for OpenNMS to consume.

You can then configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to use your custom deserializer in the Karaf shell by setting the value.deserializer property to the fully qualified name of your custom deserializer class.

Here's an example of a custom deserializer that translates the names of parameters from the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema:

java

public class CustomDeserializer implements Deserializer<CustomEvent> {

    @Override
    public CustomEvent deserialize(String topic, byte[] data) {
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        try {
            // read the bytes of the incoming message and translate them into a CustomEvent instance
            CustomEvent customEvent = objectMapper.readValue(data, CustomEvent.class);

            // translate the names of parameters in the incoming message to the expected names in the OpenNMS schema
            customEvent.setUei(customEvent.getIdentifier());
            customEvent.setSeverity(customEvent.getLevel());
            // more translations...

            return customEvent;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        // close any resources used by the deserializer
    }

}

Then, you can configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer in the Karaf shell to use your custom deserializer like this:

vbnet

config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.consumer.default
config:propset value.deserializer "com.example.CustomDeserializer"
config:update

Note that you need to replace com.example.CustomDeserializer with the fully qualified name of your custom deserializer class.

does that limit the scalability ? since i'm reading hundreds of events and alarms from kafka

Custom deserialization can add additional processing overhead, which can affect scalability, especially when processing a large number of events and alarms. However, the impact on scalability will depend on factors such as the size of the events and alarms, the complexity of the custom deserialization logic, and the performance characteristics of the underlying system.

To minimize the impact on scalability, you can try to optimize the deserialization logic as much as possible, such as using efficient data structures and algorithms, avoiding unnecessary computations, and leveraging multi-threading or parallel processing if applicable. Additionally, you can consider using a scalable messaging system, such as Apache Kafka, which is designed to handle high throughput and low-latency data streams.

can i use that java class to convert events from the kafka topics that are not protobuf to protobuf?

Yes, you can use a Java class to convert events from Kafka topics that are not in Protobuf format to Protobuf format. You would need to write a custom deserializer that can read the incoming message in its original format, extract the necessary data, and then create a Protobuf message with that data. Once you have the Protobuf message, you can then serialize it and send it to the Kafka topic that OpenNMS is consuming from.

To create a custom deserializer, you can implement the org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer interface in a Java class and override the deserialize method. In this method, you can read the incoming message and extract the necessary data to create a Protobuf message. You would then return the Protobuf message.

Here is some sample code to give you an idea of what the custom deserializer might look like:

java

public class MyCustomDeserializer implements Deserializer<Event> {

    @Override
    public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs, boolean isKey) {
        // No configuration needed
    }

    @Override
    public Event deserialize(String topic, byte[] data) {
        // Deserialize the incoming message into your original event object
        MyOriginalEvent event = deserializeMyOriginalEvent(data);

        // Create a new Protobuf message with the necessary data
        Event.Builder eventBuilder = Event.newBuilder()
                .setUei(event.getUei())
                .setSource(event.getSource())
                .setSeverity(Severity.valueOf(event.getSeverity()));

        // Set any other necessary fields in the Protobuf message

        Event protobufEvent = eventBuilder.build();

        return protobufEvent;
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        // No cleanup needed
    }

    private MyOriginalEvent deserializeMyOriginalEvent(byte[] data) {
        // Deserialize the incoming message into your original event object
        // You can use any deserialization library you like here
        MyOriginalEvent event = myDeserializationLibrary.deserialize(data);
        return event;
    }
}

You would then use this custom deserializer in your OpenNMS Kafka consumer configuration to read events from the Kafka topic in its original format and convert them to Protobuf format.

im already reading it from kafka directly why would i want another apache kafka to help me with scalability when i do a costum deserialization

Using Apache Kafka is not required, but it can provide certain benefits when it comes to scalability and reliability. For example, Kafka provides built-in support for partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance, which can help ensure that your data is always available, even in the face of failures.

That being said, if you are already able to read events directly from Kafka and you have a custom deserialization process that works for you, then there may be no need to introduce Kafka Streams into your architecture. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use Kafka Streams will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your use case.

how do i take advantage of multi-threading or parallel processing to minimize the impact on scalability with my costume deserialization ?

To take advantage of multi-threading or parallel processing to minimize the impact on scalability with custom deserialization, you can use the Kafka Streams API or Apache Spark to create a scalable stream processing pipeline that can handle large volumes of data.

The Kafka Streams API provides a lightweight stream processing library built on top of Kafka that allows for stateful processing and aggregation of data. It supports parallel processing across multiple threads or even across multiple nodes in a cluster.

Apache Spark is another popular distributed computing framework that provides a powerful API for processing large datasets in parallel. It can be integrated with Kafka using the Spark Streaming API or the Structured Streaming API to create a scalable pipeline for processing Kafka messages.

By using either of these frameworks, you can process Kafka messages in parallel across multiple threads or nodes, which can significantly improve the scalability of your pipeline. Additionally, you can take advantage of features such as caching, fault tolerance, and automatic scaling to further optimize the performance of your processing pipeline.

i cannot interfere with kafka i can only read its topics. i mean how do i do that but in the java class that as my deserialization logic?

In that case, you can use Java's built-in Executor Framework to parallelize the deserialization process. Here's a high-level overview of how you can do it:

    Create a thread pool using the ExecutorService class. This will allow you to execute deserialization tasks in parallel.

    Create a deserialization task that takes in a Kafka message and deserializes it into an OpenNMS event or alarm.

    Submit the deserialization task to the thread pool for processing using the submit() method of the ExecutorService class.

    Collect the results of the deserialization tasks using the Future objects returned by the submit() method.

    Once all deserialization tasks have completed, combine the results into a single list of OpenNMS events or alarms.

By using a thread pool and submitting deserialization tasks to it, you can take advantage of multiple threads to perform the deserialization process in parallel. This should help improve performance and minimize the impact on scalability.

Keep in mind that while parallel processing can help improve performance, it also introduces additional complexity and overhead. You will need to carefully tune your thread pool and ensure that your deserialization tasks are thread-safe and do not introduce any race conditions or other synchronization issues.

can i use activeMQ or other message broker available in openNMS to help me with the scalability problem ?

Yes, you can use ActiveMQ or other message brokers available in OpenNMS to help with scalability. These message brokers can act as a buffer between the Kafka topics and the OpenNMS application.

Instead of having the OpenNMS application read directly from the Kafka topics, the messages can be consumed by a message broker and then forwarded to the OpenNMS application in a format that is easier to handle. This can help with scalability by allowing the message broker to handle the incoming traffic and manage the load on the OpenNMS application.

Additionally, some message brokers, such as ActiveMQ, support features like message prioritization, message filtering, and message aggregation, which can further help with scalability by allowing you to prioritize and filter messages based on their importance, and aggregate multiple messages into a single message for easier processing.

Overall, using a message broker in conjunction with the OpenNMS application can help improve scalability and manageability of your event and alarm processing system.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
can i use the opennms kafka message broker to read the events and alarms from the kafka topics ?

Yes, you can use the OpenNMS Kafka message broker to read events and alarms from Kafka topics. The OpenNMS Kafka message broker allows you to configure multiple Kafka consumers to read from different Kafka topics and forward the messages to the OpenNMS message bus. Once the messages are in the message bus, they can be processed by OpenNMS, including being transformed to the correct OpenNMS format.

To configure the OpenNMS Kafka message broker to read from Kafka topics, you can create a new Kafka consumer configuration file in the OpenNMS Karaf shell. Here's an example of a configuration file that reads from a Kafka topic named "my-topic":

vbnet

opennms-kafka-consumer.cfg

kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
kafka.consumer.topics=my-topic
kafka.consumer.group.id=my-group
kafka.consumer.enable.auto.commit=true
kafka.consumer.auto.offset.reset=earliest

Once you've created the configuration file, you can start the Kafka consumer by running the following command in the OpenNMS Karaf shell:

lua

opennms-kafka-consumer:start my-config-file-name

Replace "my-config-file-name" with the name of your configuration file.

Note that you'll need to configure the OpenNMS Kafka message broker to transform the messages to the correct OpenNMS format, as described in previous answers.

how do i transform the events and alarms to the correct openNMS format while i read them with the openNMS kafka message broker ?

To transform the events and alarms to the correct OpenNMS format while reading them with the OpenNMS Kafka message broker, you will need to use a custom deserializer. You can write a custom deserializer that reads the messages from Kafka and transforms them to the expected OpenNMS format.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

    Define the expected OpenNMS format for events and alarms.
    Write a custom deserializer that reads messages from Kafka, transforms them to the expected OpenNMS format, and returns them.
    Configure the OpenNMS Kafka message broker to use the custom deserializer for reading messages.

The specific implementation details will depend on your requirements and the current state of your system. However, these general steps should help you get started.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
why is the kafka message broker a better way to read the events and alarms then using the openNMS kafka consumer ?

The OpenNMS Kafka Message Broker provides a more scalable and fault-tolerant way of reading events and alarms from Kafka topics compared to the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer. The Kafka Message Broker provides a separate Kafka topic to which the events and alarms can be published, and the OpenNMS system can subscribe to this topic to receive the data.

This approach allows multiple instances of OpenNMS to subscribe to the same topic and share the workload of processing the data, improving scalability. Additionally, the Kafka Message Broker provides features such as message persistence and delivery guarantees, making it more fault-tolerant and reliable in handling large amounts of data.

Overall, using the OpenNMS Kafka Message Broker provides a more robust and scalable approach to reading events and alarms from Kafka topics compared to the OpenNMS Kafka Consumer.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
openNMS kafka message broker works as a sort of buffer ?

Yes, the OpenNMS Kafka message broker can act as a buffer between Kafka and OpenNMS. When events or alarms are published to a Kafka topic, the message broker can read them and temporarily store them in its internal buffer. OpenNMS can then connect to the message broker and consume these events or alarms at its own pace, without worrying about directly reading from Kafka or being overwhelmed by a large volume of messages. This way, the message broker can act as a buffer to smooth out any spikes in message volume and ensure that OpenNMS is processing events and alarms efficiently.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
And the kafka consumer  keeps reading it and can became overwhelmed because it doesn't have internal buffer ? and can miss events or alarms ?

Yes, that's correct. The Kafka consumer does not have an internal buffer, so it has to read from Kafka continuously. If the consumer gets overwhelmed and falls behind, it may start to miss events or alarms.

On the other hand, the OpenNMS Kafka message broker acts as a buffer, allowing events and alarms to be stored temporarily until they can be processed by the consumer. This can help prevent the consumer from falling behind and missing events or alarms. Additionally, the message broker can provide other benefits such as load balancing and fault tolerance.

but the openNMS kafka message broker is still a better solution for scalability compared to the openNMS kafka consumer

Yes, the OpenNMS Kafka message broker is a better solution for scalability compared to the OpenNMS Kafka consumer. This is because the message broker acts as a buffer, allowing for more efficient handling of large volumes of data. Additionally, the message broker can be scaled horizontally to handle increased traffic, whereas the consumer is limited by the resources of the machine it is running on. Finally, the message broker can be configured with multiple partitions, allowing for parallel processing of data and further improving scalability.

can i configure the openNMS kafka consumer to use a costume deserialize code that turns xml to protobuf?

Yes, you can configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to use a custom deserializer that converts XML messages to protobuf format.

To do this, you would need to implement a custom deserializer that uses a parser library, such as libxml, to parse the XML messages and then converts the parsed data to protobuf format. You can then register the custom deserializer in the OpenNMS Kafka consumer configuration by setting the value.deserializer property to the fully qualified class name of your custom deserializer.

Here's an example of how you can implement a custom deserializer in Java that converts XML messages to protobuf format:

java

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer;
import com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException;
import com.example.MyProtos.MyMessage;

public class XmlToProtobufDeserializer implements Deserializer<MyMessage> {

    private String charset = "UTF-8";

    public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs, boolean isKey) {
        // Optional configuration parameters
        if (configs.containsKey("charset")) {
            charset = (String) configs.get("charset");
        }
    }

    public MyMessage deserialize(String topic, byte[] data) {
        try {
            // Parse the XML message and convert it to a Protobuf message
            XmlToProtobufConverter converter = new XmlToProtobufConverter();
            MyMessage message = converter.convert(data);

            return message;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    public void close() {
        // Nothing to do
    }
}

In this example, the XmlToProtobufDeserializer class implements the org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer interface, which defines the method for deserializing Kafka messages. The deserialize method converts the XML message to a Protobuf message using a custom XmlToProtobufConverter class, which you would need to implement.

Once you have implemented the custom deserializer, you can register it in the OpenNMS Kafka consumer configuration by setting the value.deserializer property to the fully qualified class name of your custom deserializer. For example:

csharp

opennms.event.kafka.consumer.value.deserializer=com.example.XmlToProtobufDeserializer

Note that you would also need to ensure that the Protobuf message format is compatible with the OpenNMS event schema and that the required Protobuf classes are available in the classpath of the OpenNMS Kafka consumer.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
if i do that the kafka consumer will be able to read the topics ?

If you configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to use a custom deserializer that converts XML messages to protobuf format, the consumer will be able to read Kafka topics that contain XML messages as long as the custom deserializer is able to parse and convert the messages correctly.

However, it's important to note that the OpenNMS Kafka consumer is designed to work with OpenNMS events, which are typically defined using the OpenNMS event schema and encoded in protobuf format. If you're working with XML messages that do not conform to the OpenNMS event schema, you may need to modify the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to handle these messages correctly.

Additionally, if you're using a custom deserializer that is not provided by the OpenNMS Kafka consumer, you will need to ensure that the deserializer is compatible with the Kafka client version and the message format version used by the Kafka broker. You may also need to configure the deserializer with additional parameters, such as the character encoding used by the XML messages.

Overall, using a custom deserializer to convert XML messages to protobuf format can be a powerful tool for integrating OpenNMS with other systems that use XML as their primary data format. However, it's important to thoroughly test your custom deserializer and ensure that it meets your specific requirements before deploying it in a production environment.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
but does the events from the kafka topics are passed through my costume deserializer as soon as my kafka consumer detects them ?

Yes, when you configure the OpenNMS Kafka consumer to use a custom deserializer, the consumer will use the deserializer to convert messages from the Kafka topic to the desired format as soon as it detects them.

When the OpenNMS Kafka consumer receives a message from the Kafka broker, it first deserializes the message using the configured deserializer. The deserializer converts the serialized message data to an object that can be processed by the consumer. This object can be of any type, depending on the implementation of the deserializer.

Once the message is deserialized, the OpenNMS Kafka consumer can then process the message as needed. For example, it might perform some validation on the message contents, transform the message to a different format, or store the message in a database.

If you have configured a custom deserializer that converts XML messages to protobuf format, the OpenNMS Kafka consumer will use this deserializer to convert any XML messages it receives from the Kafka topic to protobuf format. The resulting protobuf message can then be processed by the consumer.

It's important to note that the deserialization step is performed by the OpenNMS Kafka consumer, not by the Kafka broker itself. This means that the consumer needs to be running in order to process messages from the Kafka topic. If the consumer is not running or is unable to process messages for some other reason, messages will accumulate in the Kafka topic until they can be processed by the consumer.
pousaedu@protonmail.com
what more can i configure in my openNMS kafka consumer to avoid scalability issues ?

To avoid scalability issues when using the OpenNMS Kafka consumer, you can configure several properties that control how the consumer processes messages from Kafka topics. Here are some of the key properties you might consider adjusting:

    fetch.max.bytes: This property controls the maximum number of bytes that can be fetched from the Kafka broker in a single request. If you expect your messages to be very large, you may need to increase this value to avoid truncating messages. However, increasing this value can also increase memory usage and reduce throughput.

    max.poll.records: This property controls the maximum number of records that can be returned in a single poll request to the Kafka broker. If you expect a large volume of messages, you may need to increase this value to avoid message backlog. However, increasing this value can also increase the processing time for each poll request.

    fetch.min.bytes and fetch.max.wait.ms: These properties control the behavior of the Kafka broker when there are no available messages to fetch. If these values are too low, the broker may send empty responses, which can cause the consumer to consume CPU cycles while waiting for new messages. If these values are too high, the consumer may experience latency or reduced throughput.

    session.timeout.ms: This property controls the maximum amount of time that can elapse between successive heartbeats from the consumer to the Kafka broker. If this value is too low, the consumer may be marked as inactive and removed from the consumer group, which can cause rebalancing and delays in message processing. If this value is too high, the consumer may experience longer downtime before being removed from the group.

    heartbeat.interval.ms: This property controls the interval between successive heartbeats sent by the consumer to the Kafka broker. If this value is too high, the consumer may be marked as inactive and removed from the group more quickly, leading to more frequent rebalancing. If this value is too low, the consumer may consume more resources by sending more heartbeats.

    max.partition.fetch.bytes: This property controls the maximum number of bytes that can be fetched from a single partition in a single request. If you have partitions with very large messages, you may need to increase this value to avoid truncation. However, increasing this value can also increase memory usage and reduce throughput.

Overall, you should carefully consider the expected message volume and message size, and adjust these properties accordingly to ensure that your OpenNMS Kafka consumer can handle the expected load without experiencing scalability issues.
